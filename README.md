### Mae Bridgeman -- @maybe-maeb

üëã Hi! I'm Mae Bridgeman.
I'm currently a student at Boise State University, majoring in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology with a minor in Creative Writing. I am expected to graduate summa cum lade in May 2026. I love software development, especially video games and entertainment. I have several games under my belt already, and am currently working on my largest project yet, a multiplayer first-person horror game almost entirely based on sound.

### üß† My philosophy

Computers should be used to make the world a better place. Whatever I can do to aid that mission, I'm happy to do. 

Regarding video games, I believe they're one of (if not THE) greatest mediums to tell stories and convey messages. It frustrates me to see this underutilized by developers, and want to work on projects where the games I make (or help make) have a lasting impact on the people who play them.
