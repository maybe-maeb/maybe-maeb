### Mae Bridgeman -- @maybe-maeb

Hi! I'm Mae Bridgeman. I'm currently a student at Boise State University, majoring in Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology with a minor in Creative Writing. I am expected to graduate summa cum lade in May 2026. I love software development, especially video games and entertainment. I have several games under my belt already, and am currently working on my largest project yet, a multiplayer first-person horror game almost entirely based on sound.

### I'm currently working on
- Project Toph (working title): A multiplayer first-person horror game focused on sound, currently being solo-developed in Unity
- A Bachelor's Degree in [Games, Interactive Media and Mobile Technology](https://www.boisestate.edu/gimm/) with a minor in Creative Writing from Boise State University.
